# Cinematic
D1 Cinematic Assignment
Key requirements for this assignment and how they are met:
- **3+ scenes**: Cinematic includes title scene, loading scene, and main menu scene
- **2+ audio assets**: Main menu scene includes background music as well as audio blips for hovering over options  
- **2+ image assets**: The king rat logo, the cheese, the little rats, and the sewer are all hand drawn images by me
- **2+ geometric shapes**: The circles used for the loading scene were added using phaser's built in tools  
- **1+ logotype**: The text for my logo on my first scene was made by me and imported into the project
- **1+ multi-line text**: The text on my loading screen page was created using phaser's built in add.text functions
- **1+ fading animation**: My logo and loading scenes both contain fading transitions
- **1+ object motion animation**: My logo scene has the different text flying in from outside the screen and my loading screen has the cheese pulsating

All art for this cinematic was made by me either in Pixlr or on a basic whiteboard application and  
all sound effects were made by me using free online software

IMPORTANT!!!
To hear audio on menu scene you must click somewhere within the browser first, then you will be able to hear the background music
and the blips when hovering over the menu options
